# jQuery Plugins

*A collection of simple, handy plugins (See each plugin for specifics):*

### Ok Plugins

The "ok" series is typified by "just working", with minimal amount of
configuration and bloat. 

 * okNotify:: Simple Growl-like notifications, with independent notification queues
 * okReveal:: Reveal hidden content through one or more animations.
 * okSlide:: UI for linear/branching choices via panels.
 * okTips:: Flexible tooltips and more
 * okTreemap:: a framework for creating a treemap-like UI components
 * okValidate:: A lightweight, customizable form validation plugin that just works
 * okColorPicker:: Simplified Colour Picker
 * okCollapse:: Small plugin for hiding/showing list nodes
 * okDrag:: Simple, lightweight drag and drop list sorting

### Basics

Simple composable plugins. The "basic" series is all about doing more by doing
less. These plugins offer minimal amount of functionality to maximize their
composability and reuse. This is the wrong place to look if you're looking for
a drop-in solution.
 
 * basicWindow:: Displays content in the specified position (think lightbox).
 * basicCycle:: Cycle through content (think slideshow).
 * basicPosition:: Easy element positioning.

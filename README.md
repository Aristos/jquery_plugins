# jQuery Plugins

*A collection of simple, handy plugins (See each plugin for specifics):*

### ok{Plugin}

Helpful plugins, intended to maximize flexibility, while minimizing configuration and bloat. 

 * okCycle:: Tiny, modular, flexible slideshow
 * okPopup:: For popups, modal windows, tooltips etc.
 * okValidate:: A lightweight, customizable form validation plugin that just works
 * okColorPicker:: Simplified Colour Picker
 * okCollapse:: Small plugin for hiding/showing list nodes
 * okShortcut:: Easy keybinding
 * okSuggest:: Suggestion for text inputs and selects
 * okTagList:: Simple TextBoxList UI

### Basics

Simple utilities used by other more complete plugins. This is the wrong place to
be if you're looking for a drop-in solution.
 
 * basicPosition:: Easy element positioning.
 * basicLiveSearch:: Simple live search UI

### Deprecated

Don't use these. Here for historical purposes

 * ~~BasicElement:: Plugin Base~~ Just useless
 * ~~okNotify:: Simple Growl-like notifications, with independent notification queues~~ Use okPopup
 * ~~okReveal:: Reveal hidden content through one or more animations.~~ Use CSS3 Transitions
 * ~~okTips:: Flexible tooltips and more~~ Use okPopup

### Experimental

Plugins which are uncommonly used or haven't received enough testing.

 * okSlide:: UI for linear/branching choices via panels.
 * okTreemap:: a framework for creating a treemap-like UI components
 * okDrag:: Simple, lightweight drag and drop list sorting

### Pivotal

We're going to use Pivotal Tracker to manage this project. Here're
simple instructions, from Pivotal's Help "Your commit message should have square brackets
containing a hash mark followed by the story ID. If a story was not
already started (it was in the "not started" state), a commit message
will automatically start it."

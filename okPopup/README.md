# okPopup

*Tiny, modular, flexible content display* 

Thin wrapper on top of okPosition. It abstracts enough out of your way that you
can get basic functionality without fuss, but can still work directly with the
internals.

Can be used for tooltips, modal windows etc.

## Usage

## Notes

Requires jQuery 1.7.0 or greater
